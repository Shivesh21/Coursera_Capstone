Using Folium I will create a map of Johannesburg showcasing the various suburbs of the city. The venue data from each suburb will be extracted and through the use of the K-means clustering algorithm I will perform clustering on the Johannesburg data to group the suburbs together and observe the results. This project will be of interest to those looking at exploring African cities and "
